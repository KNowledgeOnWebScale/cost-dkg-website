# Website of Distributed Knowledge Graphs

We use [Walder](https://github.com/KNowledgeOnWebScale/walder) 
to build the website.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies via `npm i`.
2. Start server via `npm start`
3. The website is available at http://localhost:30000

Make sure that you set the timezone of the machine to `Europe/Brussels`.
There might be issues with displaying the event dates and times if you don't.
